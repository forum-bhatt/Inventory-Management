# Inventory-Management
Describing Inventory Control Techniques and Methods to analyze existing inventory data and stocks using Python, Power BI and Excel forms

# Inventory Control Techniques:
1. ABC Method (Always Better Control):
- Also known as Proportional Part Value Method
- Concentrates on important items and hence it is referred to as Control by Importance and Exception
- Materials are classified into three categories A, B and C
- <b> Group A </b> constitutes of items which are 10 to 20% of the total items and accounts for about 50% of the total value of stores
  - Very Strict Control
- <b> Group B </b> constitutes of 20 to 30% of the stores items and represent 30% of the total value of stores
  - Moderate Control
- <b> Group C </b> constitutes to 70 to 80% of the items are covered costing about 20% of the total value
  - Loose Control


2. VED Analysis (Vital Essential Desirable item of inventories):
- This technique is ideally suited for spare parts in inventory management like ABC analysis
- Inventories are classified into three categories as the name suggests:
- V: Vital item of inventories
  - Required for Regular Production Process
  - Non availability of this may stop the production ex. Machine
 - E: Essential item of inventories
  - Considered essential but not required for the Production Process
  - Non availability maybe tolerated for few hours or day
 - D: Desirable item of inventories
  - Does not directly affect the Production Process
  - They facilitate production and makes it more efficient ex. Greasing, oil etc

3. SDE Classification:
- It looks at the inventory availability and classifies it according to the scarcity of supply.
- S: Scare Products 
  - Which are usually imported
  - Take longer to arrive
  - Supply is harder to come by
- This technique tries to handle problem faced in lead time analysis, time-gap and purchasing strategies

4. FNSD Analysis:
- It looks at quantity, consumption rate and how often the item is issued and used
- Fast moving: Used very frequently, control check needs to be done frequently
- Normal moving: Used on regular basis, maybe needed to be purchased and stored once or twice in a year
- Slow moving: Purchase once in two years or so 
- Dead moving products: Items not required in production anymore

5. HML Analysis:
- Here, inventories are classified into three categories on the basis of product's unit price.
- H: High Cost
- M: Medium Cost
- L: Low Cost

6. SOS Analysis (Seasonal and Off Seasonal Materials):
- Materials are classified based on nature of supply
- The analysis is important where purchases and storage of materials are seasonal in nature. 
- ex. Agricularal Inputs

7. GOLF Analysis:
- Materials are classified based on their source of supply
- Government: Long Lead Time
- Ordinary: Moderate Lead Time
- Local: Locally available, minimal lead time
- Foreign: High formalities like clearance, shipping etc.

8. XYZ Analysis
- It is a way to classify inventory items according to the variability of their demand or derived/forecasted consumption
- X: Little Variation 
  - X items are characterised by steady turnover over time
  - future demans can be reliable forecasted 
- Y: Some Variation 
  - Although demand for Y items is not steady, variability can be predicted to an extent
  - This is usually because demand fluctuations are caused by known factors such as seasonality, product lifecycles, competitor action or economic factors
  - Difficult to forecast demand accurately
- Z: Most Variation 
  - Demand for Z items can fluctuate strongly or occur sporadically.
  - There is not trend or predictable casual factors, making reliable demand forecasting impossible
